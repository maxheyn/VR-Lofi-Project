# VR Lofi Project

### [== DEMO VIDEO HERE ==](https://youtu.be/Y3AzK75M9Tw)

This was a first place project for the Fall 2019 Virtual Reality Systems class at Clemson University.

In this project I led a group of 3 students (myself included) to create a Virtual Environment which simulated a "[lofi study room](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow)."

Our goal was to created a virtual environment where, given someone who wants to study or focus on something, they can do so in a relaxing interactive simulation. I'm proud to say that we successfully created this as a prototype and proof of concept, winning first place out of over 10+ other groups who also created other projects in virtual reality.

When placed into the environment, the user would be sat infront of a desk that they can control the height of with one of their handheld controllers. The idea was that the user could be sitting infront of a desk in real life, and can then make the virtual desk be calibrated to the same height as their real desk. The goal of this was to allow the user to feel more comfortable working with this virtual desk as they could then "feel" it by using their real desk.

It was created in Unity3D using the Oculus Developer Framework from the Unity Asset Store, and various other free and paid assets from the Asset Store.

This repository features the main scripts that were used for the core functionality of the project. They are not perfect by any means, as they were an introduction to Unity scripting by some of the group members, but they did the job! ðŸ˜…

Our project featured:

- Oculus Rift Support
- Importing images into the environment to study from
    - Swap between as many notes/images you want, just place them into the right folder
- Writing/drawing on images to take notes
    - Hold the controller like a pencil/pen to imitate real life note-taking
    - Saving notes to a new image
- Custom-made and free Lofi music samples
- Interactive desk height control
    - Calibrate it to your real desk height!
- Interactive objects for immersion
    - Desktop widgets
    - Study tips
- Menu system to control note taking aspects
    - Brush/notes size, color, etc.
- Aesthetic room design
    - Daytime / nighttime versions
    - City skyline outside of the window
